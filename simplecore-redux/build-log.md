# SimpleCore Redux Build Log

These are my notes for building the [SimpleCore Redux][simplecore-redux] by [Rolohaun][rolohaun] and [Chaz][chaz]

## Frame

I ordered the Funssorlab Frame Kit and it arrived 2025-12-23 in the afternoon.

Putting the frame together with the blind joints was really easy.

I recommend putting in the 22 screws into the ends of the 11 350mm extrusions that are drilled and tapped. Note that there's a spare extrusion with no tapped holes. This is the X-axis extrusion.

Slide one 350mm extrusion into the ends of two of the 500mm extrusions, making sure that the extrusions are lined up the same way and that the gantry holes are the furthest away as we're connecting the bottom of the frame first. Then tighten the screws enough that nothing slides out.

Repeat with the other set of 500mm extrusions and a 350mm extrusion between those. Again, making sure the 500mm extrusions are oriented the same way as the first pair.

Next, slide in a 350mm extrusion between the pair of uprights. Tighetening the screws enough to not slide out. Repeat with another 350mm extrusion to complete the bottom part of the frame.

Now onto the gantry extrusions. One at a time, carefully slide down an extrusion to the point where the screw lines up with the gantry holes. Tighten the screws enough to keep the extrusion in place. Repeat two more times for a total of 3 gantry extrusions.

Complete the frame by adding the top 350mm extrusions.

### Squaring and aligning the frame

The frame is now roughly put together and it's easier for us to handle. Place the frame on a stable, flat surface. Loosen two corners of screws and using an extrusion, a machinist triangle or a 1-2-3 block, make sure the 350mm extrusion is lined up with the upright 500mm extrusion and they both are flush to the bottom surface, then tighten the screw, carefully making sure the alignment is ensured. Repeat all the way around. I like to work on one extrusion at a time loosening both ends at the same time, squaring and tightening, before moving to the next.

Given the use of well machined extrusions and bliend joints most of the squaring work is already done for us.
